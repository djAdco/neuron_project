# Alzhimer's-Project
Histogram Analysis of selected numeric markers (Abeta, pTau, pTDP43, NeuN+, IBA1+, GFAP+) from the Allen Brain Institute MTG neuropathology CSV. Focused on a subset of the data to explore neuronal activity and Alzheimer's-related patterns.

Data focused on within this code is the total at8 positive area grey matter (pTau protiens) and Abeta (amyloid-beta) protiens. *ONLY focused on these numeric columns from the CSV. 

This was a beginner project, so it only shows a histogram as a visual.
